  /**
   * Add a new company to the CRM system.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The `companiesAdd` operation allows API consumers to add a new company to the CRM system by sending a POST request to the `/crm/companies` endpoint. This operation requires a request body containing the company's details to be added. Key headers include `x-apideck-consumer-id`, which is mandatory and identifies the consumer accessing the API, and `x-apideck-app-id`, which specifies the Unify application in use. Optionally, `x-apideck-service-id` can be provided to specify the service being called, useful when multiple integrations are active. The `raw` query parameter can be included to receive a raw response, primarily for debugging purposes. Upon successful creation, the API returns a `201` status code, indicating that the company has been successfully added. This operation does not support filtering or sorting, and it is crucial to ensure that all required fields in the request body are correctly populated to avoid errors.

  /**
   * Retrieve a list of companies from the CRM.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The `companiesAll` operation allows API consumers to retrieve a comprehensive list of companies from the CRM system. This GET request to the `/crm/companies` endpoint supports various query parameters to customize the response. Key parameters include `raw` for debugging purposes, `x-apideck-consumer-id` and `x-apideck-app-id` which are mandatory headers for authentication, and `x-apideck-service-id` for specifying the service when multiple integrations are active. The operation supports pagination through the `cursor` parameter and allows limiting the number of results with the `limit` parameter, which defaults to 20 and can range from 1 to 200. Users can apply filters and sorting to refine the results using the `filter` and `sort` parameters, respectively. The `fields` parameter enables users to specify which fields to include in the response, supporting nested properties via dot notation. Additionally, the `pass_through` parameter allows passing unmapped key/values to downstream services. The response will include a 200 status code upon successful retrieval of company data.

  /**
   * Retrieve detailed information about a specific company.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The 'companiesOne' operation allows API consumers to retrieve detailed information about a specific company by its unique identifier. This GET request requires the 'id' parameter in the path to specify the company record to be accessed. Additionally, the request must include the 'x-apideck-consumer-id' and 'x-apideck-app-id' headers to authenticate and identify the consumer and application making the request. Optionally, the 'x-apideck-service-id' header can be provided if multiple integrations are activated, specifying which service to query. The 'fields' query parameter enables users to customize the response by selecting specific fields to be returned, using a comma-separated list and dot notation for nested properties. The 'raw' query parameter can be used to include the raw response, primarily for debugging purposes. The operation returns a 200 status code upon successful retrieval of the company data. This endpoint is crucial for applications needing to access or display company details within a CRM context, ensuring data is accurately fetched and utilized.

  /**
   * Update a company's information in the CRM.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The `companiesUpdate` operation allows you to modify the details of an existing company record in the CRM system. This operation uses the HTTP PATCH method, which means you can update one or more fields of the company without affecting other fields. To perform this operation, you must provide the `id` of the company you wish to update in the path parameter. Additionally, the request must include the `x-apideck-consumer-id` and `x-apideck-app-id` headers to identify the consumer and the application making the request. Optionally, you can include the `x-apideck-service-id` header if the consumer has multiple integrations activated, specifying which service to target (e.g., pipedrive). The `raw` query parameter can be used to include a raw response, which is useful for debugging purposes. The request body should contain the fields you wish to update, formatted in JSON. A successful update will return a 200 status code, indicating that the company's information has been successfully modified. This operation does not support filtering or sorting, as it is intended for updating specific company records based on their unique ID.

  /**
   * Delete a company record from the CRM.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The `companiesDelete` operation allows you to remove a specific company record from the CRM system using its unique identifier. This operation is performed via a DELETE request to the `/crm/companies/{id}` endpoint, where `{id}` is the path parameter representing the ID of the company record you wish to delete.
   *
   * Key Parameters:
   * - `id` (path, required): The unique identifier of the company record to be deleted.
   * - `raw` (query, optional): Set this parameter to include the raw response, which is primarily used for debugging purposes.
   * - `x-apideck-consumer-id` (header, required): The consumer ID from which you want to delete the data.
   * - `x-apideck-app-id` (header, required): The ID of your Unify application, necessary for authentication and authorization.
   * - `x-apideck-service-id` (header, optional): Specify the service ID if the consumer has multiple integrations activated, such as 'pipedrive'.
   *
   * This operation does not support filtering or sorting as it targets a specific record by ID. Upon successful deletion, a `200 OK` response is returned, indicating that the company record has been successfully removed. Ensure that the provided `id` is correct and that the necessary headers are included to avoid authorization errors. This operation is crucial for maintaining up-to-date and accurate CRM data by allowing the removal of obsolete or incorrect company records.
