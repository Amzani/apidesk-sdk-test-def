   * Retrieve a list of companies from the CRM system.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The 'companiesAll' operation allows developers to retrieve a comprehensive list of companies stored within the CRM system. This GET request to the '/crm/companies' endpoint supports various query parameters to customize the response, such as 'limit' for controlling the number of results, 'filter' for narrowing down the list based on specific criteria, and 'sort' for ordering the results. Essential headers like 'x-apideck-consumer-id' and 'x-apideck-app-id' are required for authentication. The response is typically a JSON object containing company details, and developers can specify which fields to include using the 'fields' parameter. This operation is crucial for applications needing to access or display company data efficiently.

   * The companiesAdd operation allows developers to add a new company to the CRM system by sending a POST request to the /crm/companies endpoint.

Optionally, the x-apideck-service-id can be specified if targeting a specific service integration. The 'raw' query parameter can be set to true to receive the raw data response, useful for debugging. Upon successful creation, the API returns a 201 status code along with the ID of the newly created company resource in a JSON object.
