   * Retrieve all CRM contacts efficiently.

   * @remarks
   * The 'contactsAll' operation allows developers to retrieve a comprehensive list of CRM contacts using a GET request to the '/crm/contacts' endpoint. This operation is essential for accessing contact data across various CRM systems, enabling seamless integration and data management. Key parameters include 'raw' for debugging, 'x-apideck-consumer-id' and 'x-apideck-app-id' for authentication, and 'cursor' and 'limit' for pagination control. The response is typically a JSON object containing contact details, supporting efficient data handling and integration. This operation is crucial for applications requiring up-to-date contact information from multiple CRM platforms.

   * @remarks
   * The contactsAdd operation allows developers to add a new contact to the CRM system by sending a POST request to the /crm/contacts endpoint. This operation requires a request body containing the contact details to be added. Key headers include 'x-apideck-consumer-id' and 'x-apideck-app-id' for authentication and authorization. Optionally, 'x-apideck-service-id' can be used to specify a particular service integration. The 'raw' query parameter can be set to true to receive raw data for debugging purposes. Upon successful creation, the API returns a status code of 201 along with the newly created contact's resource ID in a JSON object format. This operation is essential for maintaining up-to-date contact information within the CRM, facilitating effective customer relationship management.

   * The 'contactsOne' operation allows you to fetch detailed information about a specific contact from the CRM system using their unique ID. This GET request requires the contact ID to be specified in the path parameter, ensuring you access the correct record. Additionally, headers such as 'x-apideck-consumer-id' and 'x-apideck-app-id' are mandatory for authentication and authorization purposes. Optional query parameters like 'fields' and 'raw' enable customization of the response, allowing you to select specific fields or receive raw data for debugging. The response is typically a JSON object containing the contact's details, facilitating seamless integration into your application.

   * The contactsUpdate operation allows you to modify the details of an existing contact in the CRM by sending a PATCH request to the /crm/contacts/{id} endpoint. This operation is crucial for maintaining up-to-date contact information, which is essential for effective customer relationship management. You must provide the contact's unique ID in the path parameter to specify which record to update. Additionally, include the x-apideck-consumer-id and x-apideck-app-id headers for authentication and authorization purposes. Optionally, use the x-apideck-service-id header if targeting a specific service integration. The request body should contain the fields you wish to update. Upon successful update, the API returns a 200 status code along with the updated contact details in a JSON object format. This operation is ideal for keeping contact information current and accurate.

   * The contactsDelete operation allows you to remove a contact from your CRM system by specifying the contact's unique ID in the endpoint path. This operation is crucial for maintaining an up-to-date and accurate contact list by removing obsolete or incorrect entries. To execute this operation, you must provide the contact ID as a path parameter, and include the x-apideck-consumer-id and x-apideck-app-id headers for authentication and authorization purposes. Optionally, you can specify the x-apideck-service-id header if targeting a specific service integration. The operation does not require a request body and, upon successful deletion, returns a status code of 200, indicating the contact was successfully removed. This operation is essential for managing contact data efficiently within your CRM.
