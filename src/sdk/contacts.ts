  /**
   * Retrieve all contacts from the CRM system.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The 'contactsAll' operation allows API consumers to retrieve a comprehensive list of contacts from the CRM system using a GET request to the '/crm/contacts' endpoint. This operation supports various query parameters to customize the response, including 'raw' for debugging purposes, 'cursor' for pagination, 'limit' to specify the number of results, 'filter' for applying specific criteria, and 'sort' for ordering the results. Additionally, the 'fields' parameter enables users to specify which fields to include in the response, allowing for efficient data retrieval. Required headers include 'x-apideck-consumer-id' and 'x-apideck-app-id', ensuring proper identification and authorization of the request. The operation also supports the 'x-apideck-service-id' header for specifying the service to call when multiple integrations are active. The response will include a 200 status code upon successful retrieval of contacts, with optional pagination cursors provided in the response metadata for navigating through large datasets. This operation is essential for accessing and managing contact data within the CRM, offering flexibility through its extensive parameter options.

  /**
   * Add a new contact to the CRM system.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The 'contactsAdd' operation allows API consumers to add a new contact to the CRM system by sending a POST request to the '/crm/contacts' endpoint. This operation requires the inclusion of specific headers, such as 'x-apideck-consumer-id' and 'x-apideck-app-id', which identify the consumer and the Unify application, respectively. Optionally, the 'x-apideck-service-id' header can be included to specify the service ID when multiple integrations are active. The request body must contain the contact details to be added. The 'raw' query parameter can be used to include a raw response, primarily for debugging purposes. Upon successful creation, the operation returns a 201 status code, indicating that the contact has been successfully added. This operation does not support filtering or sorting of contacts during the addition process.

  /**
   * Retrieve a specific contact's details from the CRM.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The 'contactsOne' operation allows API consumers to retrieve detailed information about a specific contact from the CRM system using the contact's unique identifier. This operation is performed via a GET request to the '/crm/contacts/{id}' endpoint, where the 'id' path parameter is mandatory and specifies the contact record to be retrieved.
   *
   * Key parameters include:
   * - 'x-apideck-consumer-id' (header): Required. Identifies the consumer accessing the data.
   * - 'x-apideck-app-id' (header): Required. Specifies the Unify application ID.
   * - 'x-apideck-service-id' (header): Optional. Used when multiple integrations are active, to specify the target service (e.g., pipedrive).
   * - 'raw' (query): Optional. When set, includes the raw response for debugging.
   * - 'fields' (query): Optional. Allows selection of specific fields to include in the response, using a comma-separated list and dot notation for nested properties.
   * - 'filter' (query): Optional. Enables application of filters to the data.
   *
   * The response will return a status code of 200 upon successful retrieval of the contact details. This operation does not support request bodies and is designed to efficiently fetch contact information, supporting both detailed and filtered data retrieval based on the specified parameters.

  /**
   * Update a contact record in the CRM system.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The `contactsUpdate` operation allows you to modify an existing contact record in the CRM system using a PATCH request to the `/crm/contacts/{id}` endpoint. This operation requires the `id` parameter in the path to specify the contact record you wish to update. Additionally, the request must include the `x-apideck-consumer-id` and `x-apideck-app-id` headers to authenticate the consumer and application making the request. Optionally, the `x-apideck-service-id` header can be provided if the consumer has multiple integrations activated, specifying which service to target (e.g., Pipedrive). The `raw` query parameter can be used to include the raw response, which is useful for debugging purposes. The request body should contain the fields you wish to update, formatted in JSON. A successful update returns a 200 status code, indicating the contact record has been modified. This operation does not support filtering or sorting, and it is crucial to ensure that the provided `id` corresponds to an existing contact record to avoid errors.

  /**
   * Delete a contact from the CRM system.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The `contactsDelete` operation allows API consumers to remove a specific contact from the CRM system by providing the contact's unique ID in the path parameter. This operation is performed using the HTTP DELETE method on the endpoint `/crm/contacts/{id}`.
   *
   * Key Parameters:
   * - `id` (path, required): The unique identifier of the contact to be deleted. This parameter is mandatory and must be provided in the URL path.
   * - `x-apideck-consumer-id` (header, required): Specifies the consumer ID from which data is being accessed or modified. This is essential for identifying the source of the request.
   * - `x-apideck-app-id` (header, required): The application ID associated with your Unify application, necessary for authentication and authorization purposes.
   * - `x-apideck-service-id` (header, optional): Used to specify the service ID when multiple integrations are active. This helps in directing the request to the appropriate service (e.g., Pipedrive).
   * - `raw` (query, optional): A boolean flag to include the raw response, primarily used for debugging.
   *
   * The operation does not support filtering or sorting as it targets a specific resource identified by the `id` parameter. Upon successful deletion, the API returns a status code of 200, indicating that the contact has been successfully removed. No request body is required for this operation. It is important to ensure that the `id` provided corresponds to an existing contact, as attempting to delete a non-existent contact may result in an error. Proper authentication headers must be included to authorize the operation.
