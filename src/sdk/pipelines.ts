   * Retrieve all CRM pipelines for a specified consumer.

   * @remarks
   * The 'pipelinesAll' operation fetches a list of CRM pipelines associated with a specified consumer. This GET request to the '/crm/pipelines' endpoint is essential for developers needing to access pipeline data for integration or analysis purposes. Key parameters include 'x-apideck-consumer-id' for consumer identification, 'limit' for controlling the number of results, and 'cursor' for pagination. The response is a JSON object containing pipeline details, which can be tailored using the 'fields' parameter to include specific data fields. This operation is crucial for applications that require comprehensive pipeline data from CRM systems.
