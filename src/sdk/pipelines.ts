  /**
   * Retrieve all CRM pipelines.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The 'pipelinesAll' operation retrieves a list of all CRM pipelines available to the consumer. This GET request to the '/crm/pipelines' endpoint allows users to access pipeline data, which can be filtered and customized using various query parameters. Key parameters include 'raw' for debugging purposes, 'x-apideck-consumer-id' and 'x-apideck-app-id' which are mandatory headers for authentication, and 'x-apideck-service-id' for specifying the service when multiple integrations are active. Pagination is supported via 'cursor' and 'limit' parameters, allowing users to navigate through large datasets efficiently. The 'fields' parameter enables users to specify which fields to include in the response, optimizing data retrieval by excluding unnecessary information. The operation returns a 200 status code upon successful retrieval of pipeline data. This operation is crucial for applications that need to manage or display CRM pipeline information dynamically.

  /**
   * Add a new pipeline to the CRM system.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The `pipelinesAdd` operation allows API consumers to create a new pipeline within the CRM system by sending a POST request to the `/crm/pipelines` endpoint. This operation is essential for users who need to manage sales processes and track opportunities through various stages.
   *
   * Key Parameters:
   * - `raw` (query): Optional parameter to include the raw response, primarily used for debugging purposes.
   * - `x-apideck-consumer-id` (header): Required parameter that specifies the ID of the consumer from which data is being retrieved or pushed.
   * - `x-apideck-app-id` (header): Required parameter that identifies the Unify application being used.
   * - `x-apideck-service-id` (header): Optional parameter to specify the service ID, such as 'pipedrive', especially useful when multiple integrations are active for a Unified API.
   *
   * The request body must include the details of the pipeline to be created, such as its name, stages, and other relevant attributes. Upon successful creation, the API returns a `201` status code, indicating that the pipeline has been successfully added. This operation does not support filtering or sorting, as it is focused on the creation of a single pipeline entity. It is important to ensure that all required headers are correctly set to avoid authentication errors. Additionally, consumers should handle the response appropriately to confirm the successful creation of the pipeline.

  /**
   * Retrieve a specific CRM pipeline by its ID.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The 'pipelinesOne' operation allows API consumers to retrieve detailed information about a specific CRM pipeline using its unique ID. This GET request requires the 'id' parameter in the path to specify the pipeline record to be accessed. Additionally, the request must include the 'x-apideck-consumer-id' and 'x-apideck-app-id' headers to authenticate the consumer and identify the Unify application, respectively. Optionally, the 'x-apideck-service-id' header can be provided if the consumer has multiple integrations activated, specifying which service to call. The 'raw' query parameter can be used to include the raw response, primarily for debugging purposes. The 'fields' query parameter allows users to specify which fields to include in the response, supporting nested properties through dot notation. If not specified, all available fields are returned. The operation responds with a 200 status code upon successful retrieval of the pipeline data. This operation is crucial for accessing specific pipeline details within a CRM system, facilitating data management and integration tasks.

  /**
   * Update an existing CRM pipeline.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The `pipelinesUpdate` operation allows you to update an existing pipeline within the CRM system by specifying the pipeline's unique identifier in the path parameter. This operation uses the HTTP PATCH method, enabling partial updates to the pipeline's data. Key parameters include the `id` path parameter, which is mandatory and identifies the specific pipeline to update, and several header parameters such as `x-apideck-consumer-id` and `x-apideck-app-id`, which are required for authentication and authorization purposes. The `x-apideck-service-id` header is optional and should be used when multiple integrations are active, specifying the target service (e.g., Pipedrive). Additionally, the `raw` query parameter can be included to receive a raw response, useful for debugging. The request body must contain the fields to be updated, formatted in JSON. Upon successful update, the API returns a 200 status code with the updated pipeline details. This operation does not support filtering or sorting, and it is crucial to ensure that the provided `id` corresponds to an existing pipeline to avoid errors.

  /**
   * Delete a specific CRM pipeline by ID.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The `pipelinesDelete` operation allows you to remove a specific pipeline from the CRM system by specifying its unique ID. This DELETE request requires the `id` parameter in the path, which identifies the pipeline to be deleted. Additionally, the request must include the `x-apideck-consumer-id` and `x-apideck-app-id` headers to authenticate the consumer and application making the request. Optionally, the `x-apideck-service-id` header can be provided if multiple integrations are active, specifying which service to target. The `raw` query parameter can be used to include a raw response, primarily for debugging purposes. Upon successful deletion, the API returns a 200 status code, indicating the pipeline has been successfully removed. This operation does not support filtering or sorting, and it is crucial to ensure the correct pipeline ID is provided to avoid unintended deletions.
