   * Retrieve a list of CRM users with customizable data fields.

   * @remarks
   * The 'usersAll' operation fetches a list of users from the CRM system, allowing developers to access user data efficiently. This GET request to the '/crm/users' endpoint supports various query parameters to tailor the response, such as 'fields' for selecting specific data fields, 'limit' for controlling the number of users returned, and 'cursor' for pagination. Essential headers like 'x-apideck-consumer-id' and 'x-apideck-app-id' are required for authentication and routing. The response is typically a JSON object containing user details, and the 'raw' parameter can be used to include raw data for debugging purposes. This operation is crucial for applications needing to integrate or display CRM user information dynamically.

   * @remarks
   * The 'usersAdd' operation allows you to add a new user to your CRM system by sending a POST request to the /crm/users endpoint. This operation is essential for expanding your user base within the CRM, enabling better management and interaction with customer data. Key parameters include 'x-apideck-consumer-id' and 'x-apideck-app-id', which are required for authentication and routing the request to the correct application context. Optionally, 'raw' can be set to true to receive raw data for debugging purposes. Upon successful creation, the operation returns a 201 status code along with the ID of the newly created user in a JSON object.

This GET request requires the 'id' parameter in the path to specify the user record to retrieve. Additionally, headers such as 'x-apideck-consumer-id' and 'x-apideck-app-id' are mandatory for authentication and routing purposes. Optionally, the 'x-apideck-service-id' header can be used to target a specific service integration, and query parameters like 'raw' and 'fields' can be utilized to customize the response. The response is typically a JSON object containing the user's details, facilitating seamless integration and data retrieval for CRM applications.

   * The usersUpdate operation allows you to modify existing user records in the CRM system by sending a PATCH request to the /crm/users/{id} endpoint. This operation is crucial for keeping user information up-to-date and accurate. You must provide the user's ID in the path parameter to specify which record to update. Additionally, the request requires headers for authentication and authorization, including x-apideck-consumer-id and x-apideck-app-id. Optionally, you can specify x-apideck-service-id if targeting a specific service integration. The request body should contain the fields you wish to update. Upon successful execution, the operation returns a status code of 200, indicating the user record has been updated. The response typically includes the updated user details in a JSON format.

   * The usersDelete operation allows you to remove a user from the CRM system by specifying their unique ID in the endpoint path. This operation is crucial for managing user data and ensuring that outdated or incorrect user records are efficiently removed. To execute this operation, you must provide the user's ID in the path, along with necessary headers such as x-apideck-consumer-id and x-apideck-app-id for authentication and authorization. Optionally, you can specify the x-apideck-service-id if targeting a specific service integration. The operation does not require a request body and returns a status code of 200 upon successful deletion, indicating that the user has been successfully removed from the system.
