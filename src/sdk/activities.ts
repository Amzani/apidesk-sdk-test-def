  /**
   * Retrieve all CRM activities with customizable query options.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The `activitiesAll` operation allows developers to retrieve a comprehensive list of CRM activities using a GET request to the `/crm/activities` endpoint. This operation is essential for accessing activity data across various CRM integrations, enabling users to manage and analyze customer interactions effectively. Key parameters include `x-apideck-consumer-id` and `x-apideck-app-id`, which are mandatory headers for identifying the consumer and application. Optional query parameters such as `cursor`, `limit`, `filter`, and `sort` provide flexibility in navigating and organizing the data. The `fields` parameter allows for selective data retrieval, enhancing performance by returning only specified fields. The response is a JSON object containing the requested activities, facilitating seamless integration into applications and workflows. This operation supports debugging with the `raw` parameter and allows additional query customization through `pass_through`. The response includes pagination details for efficient data handling.

  /**
   * Add a new activity to the CRM system.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The `activitiesAdd` operation allows developers to create a new activity within the CRM system by sending a POST request to the `/crm/activities` endpoint. This operation is essential for integrating and managing customer interactions and tasks within a unified CRM platform.
   *
   * Key Parameters:
   * - `x-apideck-consumer-id` (header, required): Specifies the consumer ID for data retrieval or submission.
   * - `x-apideck-app-id` (header, required): Identifies the Unify application making the request.
   * - `x-apideck-service-id` (header, optional): Indicates the specific service to call, necessary when multiple integrations are active.
   * - `raw` (query, optional): Determines if the raw response should be included, mainly for debugging.
   *
   * Upon successful creation, the operation returns a `201` status code along with a JSON object containing the unique identifier of the newly created activity. This response confirms the successful addition of the activity to the CRM system.

   * - **id** (path): The unique identifier of the activity record to retrieve. This parameter is mandatory.
   * - **x-apideck-consumer-id** (header): Required to specify the consumer ID for data retrieval.
   * - **x-apideck-app-id** (header): The ID of the Unify application making the request, also required.
   * - **x-apideck-service-id** (header): Optional parameter to specify the service ID when multiple integrations are active.
   * - **raw** (query): Optional parameter to include the raw response, useful for debugging.
   * - **fields** (query): Allows specifying which fields to include in the response, using a comma-separated string for selective data retrieval.
   *
   * Response Behavior: The operation returns a JSON object representing the CRM activity, including all requested fields. This enables developers to integrate or display specific activity details within their applications efficiently.

  /**
   * Update an existing activity record in the CRM.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The `activitiesUpdate` operation allows developers to modify an existing activity record within the CRM system. This operation is crucial for maintaining up-to-date information about activities, ensuring that any changes or updates are accurately reflected in the CRM.
   *
   * To perform this operation, the `id` parameter is required in the path to specify which activity record is being updated. Additionally, the request must include headers such as `x-apideck-consumer-id` and `x-apideck-app-id` to authenticate and identify the application making the request. The optional `x-apideck-service-id` header can be used if multiple integrations are active, specifying which service to target.
   *
   * The operation supports a `raw` query parameter for debugging purposes, allowing the inclusion of raw responses. Upon successful execution, the operation returns a status code of 200, indicating that the activity record has been updated. The response includes a JSON object representing the updated resource, ensuring developers can confirm the changes made.
