  /**
   * Retrieve all CRM notes with optional filtering and field selection.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The 'notesAll' operation allows API consumers to retrieve a comprehensive list of notes from the CRM system. This GET request to the '/crm/notes' endpoint supports various query parameters to customize the response. Key parameters include 'raw' for debugging purposes, 'cursor' for pagination, and 'limit' to control the number of results returned, with a default of 20 and a maximum of 200. The 'fields' parameter enables users to specify which fields to include in the response, supporting nested properties through dot notation. Required headers include 'x-apideck-consumer-id' and 'x-apideck-app-id', ensuring proper identification of the consumer and application. An optional 'x-apideck-service-id' header can be used when multiple integrations are active. The operation returns a 200 response code upon success, delivering the requested notes data. This operation is essential for accessing and managing CRM notes efficiently, with flexibility in data retrieval and integration support.

  /**
   * Add a new note to the CRM system.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The 'notesAdd' operation allows API consumers to add a new note to the CRM system by sending a POST request to the '/crm/notes' endpoint. This operation is essential for users who need to programmatically create notes associated with CRM records.
   *
   * Key Parameters:
   * - 'raw' (query): Optional parameter to include the raw response, primarily used for debugging purposes.
   * - 'x-apideck-consumer-id' (header): Required parameter that specifies the ID of the consumer from which data is being retrieved or pushed.
   * - 'x-apideck-app-id' (header): Required parameter indicating the ID of the Unify application being used.
   * - 'x-apideck-service-id' (header): Optional parameter to specify the service ID (e.g., pipedrive) when multiple integrations are active for a Unified API.
   *
   * Request Body: The request must include a body containing the note details to be added.
   *
   * Response: A successful operation returns a 201 status code, indicating that the note has been successfully created.
   *
   * This operation does not support filtering or sorting of notes during creation. It is crucial for maintaining accurate and up-to-date records within the CRM system, facilitating better customer relationship management.

  /**
   * Retrieve a specific note by ID from the CRM system.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The 'notesOne' operation allows API consumers to retrieve a specific note from the CRM system using its unique identifier. This GET request requires the 'id' parameter in the path to specify the note to be retrieved. Additionally, the request must include the 'x-apideck-consumer-id' and 'x-apideck-app-id' headers to authenticate the consumer and identify the application making the request. Optionally, the 'x-apideck-service-id' header can be provided if the consumer has multiple integrations activated, specifying which service to call. The 'raw' query parameter can be used to include the raw response for debugging purposes. The 'fields' query parameter allows users to specify which fields to include in the response, supporting nested properties through dot notation. The operation returns a 200 status code upon successful retrieval of the note, with the response containing the requested fields or all available fields if none are specified. This operation does not support filtering or sorting beyond the specified fields.

  /**
   * Update an existing CRM note by ID.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The 'notesUpdate' operation allows API consumers to modify an existing note in the CRM system by specifying the note's unique identifier in the path parameter. This operation uses the HTTP PATCH method, enabling partial updates to the note's content. Key parameters include the 'id' path parameter, which is mandatory and identifies the specific note to be updated. Additionally, the 'x-apideck-consumer-id' and 'x-apideck-app-id' headers are required to authenticate the request and specify the application context. The 'x-apideck-service-id' header is optional and should be used when multiple integrations are active, to specify the target service. The 'raw' query parameter can be included to receive a raw response, useful for debugging. The request body must contain the fields to be updated, formatted in JSON. Upon successful update, a 200 status code is returned, indicating the note has been modified. This operation does not support filtering or sorting, and it is crucial to ensure that the note ID exists before attempting an update to avoid errors.

  /**
   * Delete a specific note from the CRM system.
   *
   * @remarks
   * The `notesDelete` operation allows API consumers to remove a specific note from the CRM system by providing the unique identifier of the note in the path parameter. This DELETE request requires the `id` parameter, which specifies the note to be deleted. Additionally, the request must include the `x-apideck-consumer-id` and `x-apideck-app-id` headers to authenticate the consumer and identify the Unify application, respectively. Optionally, the `x-apideck-service-id` header can be provided if the consumer has multiple integrations activated, specifying which service to target. The `raw` query parameter can be used to include a raw response, primarily for debugging purposes. The operation does not support filtering or sorting, as it targets a single resource. Upon successful deletion, a 200 status code is returned, indicating the note has been successfully removed. This operation is crucial for maintaining up-to-date and relevant data within the CRM by allowing the removal of obsolete or incorrect notes.
