This field helps prevent data conflicts by ensuring that updates are only applied to the latest version of the data. Each modification to the address increments this value, which must be included in update requests to verify that the data has not changed since it was last retrieved. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity in environments with multiple users or systems accessing the CRM simultaneously.   | 1-12345                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
