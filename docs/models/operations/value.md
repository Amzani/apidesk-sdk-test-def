# Value

This field allows for the inclusion of custom data specific to the company being added. It is not required but can be used to store additional information that does not fit into the standard fields. This flexibility is useful for businesses that need to track unique attributes or metrics related to their operations. The value should be formatted as a string and can include any relevant data that enhances the company's profile within the CRM.
