This value is automatically incremented with each update to ensure data integrity and prevent conflicts during concurrent modifications. It is crucial for developers to use this property when implementing update operations to verify that the data being modified is the most recent version. | 1-12345                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
