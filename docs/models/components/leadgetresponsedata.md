This identifier is automatically generated by the system when a lead is created and is used to precisely target and update the correct lead record. Although not required for the update operation, providing this ensures that the correct lead is modified, especially in systems with large datasets where name collisions might occur. It is crucial for maintaining data integrity and avoiding accidental updates to the wrong record.                                                                             | 12345                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

This feature is particularly useful for integrating with third-party services that require additional parameters or configurations not covered by standard fields. It enables flexibility and extensibility in handling unique business requirements or workflows that involve multiple systems. Each entry in the array should adhere to the expected structure defined by the target service. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
