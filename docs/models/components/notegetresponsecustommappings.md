# NoteGetResponseCustomMappings

This object contains any custom mappings that have been configured for the note resource. Custom mappings allow for additional, user-defined fields to be associated with the note, providing flexibility to adapt the CRM to specific business needs. This property is included when such mappings are present, enabling users to extend the standard note functionality with custom attributes that can capture unique business data. This is particularly useful in scenarios where standard fields do not fully capture the required information, allowing for a more tailored CRM experience.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { NoteGetResponseCustomMappings } from "apideck/models/components";

let value: NoteGetResponseCustomMappings = {};
```
