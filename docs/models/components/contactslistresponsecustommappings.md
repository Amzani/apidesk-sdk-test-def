# ContactsListResponseCustomMappings

This object contains any custom mappings that have been configured for the contact resource. Custom mappings allow for the adaptation of the contact data to fit specific business needs or third-party integrations. They are particularly useful when integrating with multiple CRM systems or when specific fields need to be aligned with external data structures. This property is optional and will only be included if custom mappings are set up for the contact.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { ContactsListResponseCustomMappings } from "apideck/models/components";

let value: ContactsListResponseCustomMappings = {};
```
