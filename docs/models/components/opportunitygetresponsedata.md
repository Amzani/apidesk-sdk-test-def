This feature is particularly useful for integrating with external services or applying custom business logic that requires additional data not covered by standard fields. It supports flexibility and extensibility in handling unique business requirements during the update process.                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
